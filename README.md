# Quick-Stocks
Chrome extension that provides financial data, news, and current stock prices for websites dedicated to certain multi-national companies.

Quick Stocks allows a user to conveniently access the financials of certain publicly traded companies. This is done by identifying the certain company that a website (online store, web article, etc) is created for and providing links to that company for its news, current stock prices, and financial web commentaries to provide the user with insight to a corporation for quantitative and qualitative analysis. Currently the chrome extension is functional for the following companies with more to be added in future updates: 

Google, Apple, Samsung, Amazon, Microsoft, McDonald's, Facebook, Twitter, Shell, Pepsi, Coca-Cola, Walmart, Nike, Adidas, Volkswagen, Toyota, Costco, Ford, Tesla, Roblox, Pfizer, Cvs, Zoom, Kroger, Revlon, Hyundai, Nissan, Intel, IBM, Disney, Mastercard, Visa, Alibaba, Nokia.
